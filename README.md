## 🎮 What is Mr. Potato?

**Mr. Potato** is a quirky browser-based experience where you can mix and match different facial features and accessories to bring your perfect (or most chaotic) potato to life. Think Mr. Potato Head meets surrealist art.

There’s no goal. No timer. No stress. Just you, a potato, and your imagination.
